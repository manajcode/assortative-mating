File MA.R contains the R code I created to peform logistic regressions on the mate choice behavior data of Najarro et al. 2015 (https://peerj.com/articles/1173.pdf), and code for constructing plots in GGplot2. 


The following is a directory to the files contained in MA.R:

1) binomial analysis of pooled 3-way data based on diet of chooser 12-16-14.R:
R code written to perform binomial analyses on the various counts of different mating behavior patterns.


2)consesnsus test for combined p-value of pooled arrangements in 3way data 5.11.15.R:
R code written to perform Stouffer's Z test on all pooled mating behavior data across various experiments (both mine and Sharon et al. 2010).


3)logistic regresssion for 4way data on 5.15.15.R-R: code used to evaluate covariate dependence in the four wate mating behavior in order to determine whether mating dat across different experiments could be pooled together.
 - use logistic regression data for R analysis on 5.15.15.csv


4)revised binomial tests for 3-way mate choice exp 7.18.14.R:
 R code written to perform binomial tests on the three-way mate choice frequencies.


5)revevised 4way pooled frequencies on 5.1.15.R:
This R code contains the code I used to create a ggplot2 bar graph depicting the frequencies of pooled assortative matings for each fly strain tested, compared to the results of a previous experiments performed by SHaron et al 2010. This plot was used in my masters thesis. 
- use the workspace titled "workspace for 4.6.14.RData"


6)revised 3way pooled frequencies on 5.7.15.R
This R code contains the code I used to I used to create a ggplot2 bar graph depicting the frequencies of assortative matings in the three-way mate choice experiments, for the two strains of fly I tested.
- use the file "copmile3-way mate choice data 7.8.csv"


7)revised 3way time data box plots with new names on 5.7.15.R
This R code contains the codie I used to create ggplot2 box plots to assess copulation latency and duration in the three-way mate choice experiments.
- use the file "raw CL and CD data for three and fourway matings boxplot  8.25.14.csv"
